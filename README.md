This coding standard guideline is established to be used for all Manavi Solution repositories.

## General Guidelines

- Within ```()``` a single \s(space) must be added before the first parameter and after the last parameter, and a space after each ```,``` separator ```( a, b, c )```
- Within ```[]``` for Array access
  - No spacing is added when accessing an index with standard data types ```["index"] or [0]```
  - Space is padded when accessing via a variable or function ```[ $i ]```
- There must be a space added before operators and opening ```(``` such as ```if (``` or ```foreach (```
